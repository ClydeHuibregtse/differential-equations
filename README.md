# Differential Equations

Basis: `du/dt = f(u, t)`

# To Do

Done:
1. Abstraction for arrays of arbitrary dimension accepting arbitrary element type

To Do:
1. `ODEProblem`/`ODESolution` constructors + helper methods
2. Base-level documentation (see how it work with inline tests)
3. Sample tests for common diffeqs
4. Implement a few algorithms:
   1. Euler
   2. BackwardEuler
   3. RungeKutta
